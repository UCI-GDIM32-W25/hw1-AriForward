## Devlog
I think the breakdown I did in class works pretty well as a plan because it had just about everything I needed to work on for homework. It was clear the whole time what I needed to create in my code. For example, I knew the character needed to have a sprite, move around with WASD, and plant things with space bar. I made all these things happen in my code as well.

## Prof comments
Your Devlog is a little too short for me to give full credit for it. The Devlog prompt specifically asked you to write about how your breakdown connects to the code that you wrote, and to mention a few specific things in your Unity project or code like names of Components or methods used. That being said, I'm really glad the break-down helped out your process- just make sure to be more detailed and mention code in your Devlog for HW2 so I can give you full points for it! :)

Also, please consider formatting your break-down activities with the hyphen '-' symbol as suggested above, and remove the prompts. This will make it a lot easier for me to read. See the [README formatting guide here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
